## Hey, I'm Alibeg 👋

> *Unfocused, yet deeply focused.*

I'm a Computer Science student from **Ashgabat, Turkmenistan**, studying AI & Expert Systems at Oguz Han Engineering and Technology University. I've been writing code since I was 14 — that's over 4 years of building things, breaking things, and learning from both.

I work across the full stack — web, mobile, and AI. I enjoy taking ideas from zero to a working product, whether it's a web platform with Django or a cross-platform app with Flutter.

### What I work with

**Languages**
`Python` `JavaScript` `Dart` `HTML` `CSS`

**Frameworks & Tools**
`Django` `Flutter` `Tailwind CSS`

**Data & Infrastructure**
`MongoDB` `Cloudflare` `DigitalOcean`

**Spoken Languages**
🇬🇧 English (B1) · 🇹🇷 Turkish (C1) · 🇹🇲 Turkmen (C1) · 🇷🇺 Russian (A2) · 🇯🇵 Japanese (N5)

### What I'm focused on

- Deepening my knowledge in **AI/ML engineering**
- Building a **Turkmen language TTS/STT model** trained entirely on native speech data
- Contributing to the Turkmen-language tech ecosystem

### Highlights

🏆 **4× National Project Competition Winner** — 1st place in nationwide competitions across Turkmenistan at ages 17 and 18, and continued winning at the national level after that

📱 **OguzMath** — Built a math application actively used at Oguz Han University

📜 Certified in data science & analytics through platforms like DataCamp

### Beyond code

I play chess and Clash Royale. I like thinking in systems — whether it's on a board, in a game, or inside a codebase.

### Let's connect

I'm currently looking for **remote junior developer / AI engineer** opportunities, ideally at a startup where I can grow fast and contribute meaningfully.

Feel free to reach out — I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaborations.
